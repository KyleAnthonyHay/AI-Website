HTML/CSS/JAVACRIPT Website

## Description

This si a responsive website advertising the benifits of AI technology using HTML/CSS/Javacript. 

### Issues Encountered
- The javascsript implementation of the Navbar was dissaprearing when the screen resolution width was under 480px. This was due to a syntax error in the class naming. CLASS NAMING IS SESNSITIVE TO SPACES.

- Errors were generated by falty use of Div's and class names. This prevented the csss styles from being applied to the elements targeted. For example, if class **'A'** is wrapped inside another div with class **'B'** the CSS code targetting class **'A'** was unable to target the desired group because its content was wrapped in the wrong div with the wrong class name(B).
